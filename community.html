            <p>Welcome!

            <ul>
                <li>Connect with educators, researchers, developers, students, and advocates.</li>
                <li>Share ideas, resources, and best practices related to DEI and ethical AI.</li>
                <li>Discuss challenges and solutions in navigating the current landscape of DEI in education.</li>
                <li>Contribute to a collective effort to promote responsible and equitable AI development.</li>
